# bsbl-tomorrow
Repository of Machine Learning models designed to predict how current MLB players will play tomorrow, next week, in a year, and 5 years into the future.

## Data Source

Data for this project is hosted in a [hugging face dataset repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jensen-holm/statcast-era-pitches) that contains a parquet file with every MLB pitch from the Statcast era up through the last season (2015-2023 as of now).
